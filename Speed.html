                    This project was significatly larger in scale and unlike the others was done as a group project. The goals of the project were to build an online app where a user
                    could play the card game Speed in realtime with other plays around the world. This would require, realtime updates on both ends, a match making system, an account
                    creation and login system, and a chatting features to find players. 
                </div>
                <div>
                    Due to the scale, we needed to break the requirements up to each developer. My main tasks were to create the login and sign up system. I was also tasked with creating
                    a system to shuffle a deck of cards and distribute them amoungst the players and the piles needed to play speed. This project is still on going and not quite at a playable state.
                    However much of the structure is built, and future work will allow us to flesh it out more.

                <h3>Utilized Technology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>React: The components making up the user interface are constructed using React. This library offers added structure when rendering components in real time
                        using JavaScript
                    </li>
                    <li>JavaScript: All game logic is programmed in JavaScript due to its universality in the world of webpages.</li>
                    <li>Express: A web application framework for Node.js that acted as the 'backend' server of this application. It was used as the runner and processor between the
                        client-side server, and the Mongo Database storing long term.
                    </li>
                    <li>MongoDB: A NoSQL database being run virtually through the cloud rather than locally by the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>Node.js: The technology used to host the servers both client-side and server-side</li>
                    <li>Sha-256: A library used to hash the passwords to keep them safe as they moved accross the network.</li>
                    <li>Socket.io: The intoduction of two connections to the server interacting with one another required us to intoduce websockets into the project to make sure all users
                        are updated in real time of any changes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bootstrap: A lightweight and easy to implement package that offers compact CSS to augment HTML and give off a professional look.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tech Challanges</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Presentation: The goal of this project was to make it look professional and clean, thus we needed to pay close attention to how we built the components and what
                        the user saw and interacted with.
                    </li>
                    <li>State Tracking: The complexity of the states in this project required us to build multiple states as well as lean on sessions and cookies to help track connections.</li>
                </ul>
