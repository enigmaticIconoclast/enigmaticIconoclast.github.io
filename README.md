This page is acting as a portfolio and final project for CS3750 Summer 2023 and is featuring projects done by Lilith Eggleston over the course of the class.
The aim of this portfolio is to demonstate, document, and explain the 4 projects that were tackled this semester as well as act as a centeral hub linking the projects together.
If a README file is more your speed to understand these projects this file will document all the written text of the pages and link to the GitHub Repositories for any to explore.
Starting off the projects we have the TicTacToe game. To give context this was where we first started dipping our toes into react. Our goal was to build a simple game with simple graphics based on a web based guide. While the challenges of this project weren't very present due to the existence of the guide, it allowed us to understand the set up of react Apps, familarize ourselves with JavaScript and begin to see how issues like persisting data, or events were handled in JS as well as how to render HTML in real time.
The next major project was a connect 4 game. The challenge of this project was two fold, not only to take the existing TicTacToe game and modifying it to work as connect 4 but also adding in a Mongo Database. This is where we really shifted into a MERN development stack and started to see the larger picture. While expanding the 3X3 grid of tictactoe to the 7x6 grid of connect 4 wasnt hard. A major challange was modifying to game to simulate gravity in a placed piece falling into place from the top. This was handled by making each column act as its own handler. Once a player clicks in the column the code loops through each place starting at the top until it finds either the bottom or a filled in space. It then fills the previous space it read. If the column is full than nothing happens. The final challenge was around the other technology we were adding a Mongo database and express server to host it.
