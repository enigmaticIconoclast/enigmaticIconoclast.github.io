                    This Tic Tac Toe Game project had the goal of building the classic game Tic Tac Toe in a web based format. The game is played on a 3x3 grid and players take
                    turns placing either an X or an O. The first player to get 3 in a row be it diagonal, horizontal, or vertical wins.

                <div>
                    The game is run using React and a built component called "Board". This board handles the players actions and is used to display the current players turn as
                    well as the outcome should someone win.

                <h3>Utilized Technology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>React: The components making up the user interface are constructed using React. This library offers added structure when rendering components in real time
                        using JavaScript
                    </li>
                    <li>JavaScript: All game logic is programmed in JavaScript due to its universality in the world of webpages.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tech Challanges</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Persistance: Due to the fact the component was updating in real time and refreshing the UI, the client side server needed to keep track of its State.
                    </li>
                    <li>Winning: A way of determing a winner or if there was a tie was crucial to turn this project into a proper game.</li>
                </ul>
