                    The login project had two simple goals, to give more practice with the database, and to become familar with some of the industries best practices around security.
                    Utilizing the same MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to build a user friendly experience.

                <h3>Utilized Technology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>React: The components making up the user interface are constructed using React. This library offers added structure when rendering components in real time
                        using JavaScript
                    </li>
                    <li>JavaScript: All game logic is programmed in JavaScript due to its universality in the world of webpages.</li>
                    <li>Express: A web application framework for Node.js that acted as the 'backend' server of this application. It was used as the runner and processor between the
                        client-side server, and the Mongo Database storing long term.
                    </li>
                    <li>MongoDB: A NoSQL database being run virtually through the cloud rather than locally by the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>Node.js: The technology used to host the servers both client-side and server-side</li>
                    <li>Sha-256: A library used to hash the passwords to keep them safe as they moved accross the network.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tech Challanges</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Security Standards: Ensuring the password was only ever passed over the network in a hashed from required most of the work to be handled front end
                        with only calling the server when absolutely needed. While User Creation was straight forward hashing the password with a salt score and passing both with 
                        a username to the express server for storage. The login required the client to reach out with the username first to get the salt score, then sending the
                        hashed password the user entered for validation by the express server.
                    </li>
