                    The Connect 4 Project was a continuation of the TicTacToe game but this time utilizing the entire MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. Mongo and an
                    express server were the main additions to the project in order to track records.

                    The game delivers on its goals which were to expand the TicTacToe UI to fully represent the Connect 4 game. Like before the Players take turns, however now they
                    are dropping 'discs' rather than placing letters. The discs would fall down their column until they meet either the bottom or another piece. The first player to
                    get 4 in a row would be the winner.

                <h3>Utilized Technology</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>React: The components making up the user interface are constructed using React. This library offers added structure when rendering components in real time
                        using JavaScript
                    </li>
                    <li>JavaScript: All game logic is programmed in JavaScript due to its universality in the world of webpages.</li>
                    <li>Express: A web application framework for Node.js that acted as the 'backend' server of this application. It was used as the runner and processor between the
                        client-side server, and the Mongo Database storing long term.
                    </li>
                    <li>MongoDB: A NoSQL database being run virtually through the cloud rather than locally by the server. Acted as long term storage for all projects moving forward
                    </li>
                    <li>Node.js: The technology used to host the servers both client-side and server-side</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tech Challanges</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logic: A major hurdle of this project was ensuring the pieces would fall into their proper place no matter where the player clicked in a column.
                        This was solved by treating the 'squares' as an array and looping through options that would be beneath the current square until a space with no
                        further decent was found.
                    </li>
                    <img src="/Images/Connect4Gravity.png">
                    <li>Storage: Ensuring the highscores were properly saved and fetchable at any time the player moved to the highscores page required a call and response
                        handler to be programed on the express side. Thus any time the client needed to "post" a new high score, or fetch the table of records, the server would
                        be sure to handle it and pass the required data back to the client.
                    </li>
                </ul>
